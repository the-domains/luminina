For any sales to an Indonesia-based customer, PT AT&T would lead the sales effort, coordinate all aspects of the sale and enter into contract for the transactions. However, such sales derived by PT AT&T from Indonesian-based accounts are not significant. PT AT&T must follow the best practices and strategies developed by AT&T U.S, in connection with sales activities performed at the local level.
